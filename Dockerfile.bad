# ❌ UNOPTIMIZED VERSION - Don't use this!
# Problems:

# - No layer caching optimization
# - Includes dev dependencies
# - Runs as root user

FROM node:18

# Copy everything first (breaks caching)
COPY . /app

WORKDIR /app

# Install ALL dependencies including dev
RUN npm install

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["npm", "start"]

# Result: ~1GB image size 😱
